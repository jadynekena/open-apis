# Open-apis
List of direct URLs to access to few Open API datasets (no auth required).

# Goal
The listed URLs can be used to test API access points immediately. No need to check the documentation. No need to manually add the parameters. Grab them and test them in your applications !

# File source
Get it [here](src.json).

# Contribution
Feel free to make a PR !

# Usecase
Check out my dataviz website that relies on this repo : [Jsonvizz](jsonvizz.jadynekena.com). If many people ask for it, I can make this other project open source.
